# Tip Calculator

## Name: Emily Yang

**Tippy** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip. In addition, if the user specifies the number of people in the party, the app will also split the bill evenly and calculate the amount each person would pay.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
* [X] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [X] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [X] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [X] Custom colors palette selected
* [X] Ability to split the bill across any number of people

## Notes

A challenge that I had with building this app was figuring out how to disable and re-enable the EditText field for the party size, since it wouldn't make sense for the user to enter in the number of people in the group before the bill amount was entered. Another challenge I had was figuring out how to clear out the party size and split amount when the bill amount was cleared out.
